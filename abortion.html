              Abortion has no place in Wisconsin. Although women may want the
              right to choose, so do the unborn persons-- but we can't ask them
              can we?
            </p>
            <p>
              BUT If you want to an abortion, you should just drive to Illinois,
              just like Kyle Rittenhouse did! If you want to cross the border to
              commit murder, be my guest!

                I believe justice has been served in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial.

            <h2>Contraception is a SIN</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">August 22, 2022 by RJ</p>
            <p>
              The Bible is CLEAR about contraception: it is against it. Only God
              should decide who gets pregnant (and remains pregnant). And no one
              should get to choose how they don't get pregnant. So no one should
              have legal access to <i>any</i> contraception of <i>any</i> kind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyone who says I am open to contraception does not understand my
              steadfast belief in the bible.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote p-3">
              <p>
                Gen. 38:7-10<br />
                (7) And Her, the firstborn of Juda, was wicked in the sight of
                the Lord: and was slain by him. (8) Juda therefore said to Onan
                his son: Go in to thy brother's wife and marry her, that thou
                mayst raise seed to thy brother. (9) He, knowing that the
                children should not be his, when he went in to his brother's
                wife, spilled his seed upon the ground,6 lest children should be
                born in his brother's name. (10) And therefore the Lord slew
                him, because he did a detestable thing.
              </p>

            <p>
              That is one of my favorite lines from the Good Book. Masturbation
              is an abomination according to the bible, and it should be against
              the law. Any other form is contraception should also be against
              the law.
            </p>
            <p>
              As long as I am a senator, I will stand up for what is right and
              biblical and lawful.

            <p>
              I recently introduced a bill that would prevent abortion when a
              fetus is able to feel pain, because no person should be aborted
              when they can feel pain.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe God gave us religion so we can understand God better:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote p-3">
              <p>
                Psalm 7:11-13 <br />
                God is a righteous judge, And a God who has indignation every
                day. If a man does not repent, He will sharpen His sword; He has
                bent His bow and made it ready. He has also prepared for Himself
                deadly weapons; He makes His arrows fiery shafts.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I believe God gave us religion so we can save sinners. That's why
              I start the Joseph Project with Pastor Jerome Smith of Greater
              Praise Church of God in Christ, an initiative that connects folks
              with good jobs and is truly turning sinners's lives around.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here in Wisconsin, we have plenty of sinners that need help. Many
              of my teachers and pastors are sinners. And they need my help. I
              take the lesson from Psalms and hope they repent just like I did.
