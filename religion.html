              The Freedom of Religion means Americans are able to practice to
              worship the way they see fit, free from persecution, free from
              liberal revisions of the one true word.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Freedom of Religion also means I don't need to hide my
              religion from anyone else, especially those who don't believe in
              the same things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Americans should be able to exercise their religous beleifs,
              because you don't stop being a true Christian when you clock into
              Walmart or Kwik Trip.
            </p>

              That is one of my favorite lines from the Good Book. I try to
              remind myself of it whenever I see people, like the vocal liberal
              extremists, being loud and obnoxious, because then I think about
              the silent agreers -- because <i>Mark</i> says they are
              <i>for</i> us, and they're often women too.

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">August 31, 2022 by RJ</p>
            <p>
              Some religious fanatics say that religion exists so that
              <i>men</i> can worship God. I believe God put us on Earth so that
              we can enjoy that he created for us. He wanted us to thrive. And
              he made us exceptional and <i>elite</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe God gave us religion so we can understand God better:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote p-3">
              <p>
                Psalm 7:11-13 <br />
                God is a righteous judge, And a God who has indignation every
                day. If a man does not repent, He will sharpen His sword; He has
                bent His bow and made it ready. He has also prepared for Himself
                deadly weapons; He makes His arrows fiery shafts.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I believe God gave us religion so we can save sinners. That's why
              I start the Joseph Project with Pastor Jerome Smith of Greater
              Praise Church of God in Christ, an initiative that connects folks
              with good jobs and is truly turning sinners's lives around.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here in Wisconsin, we have plenty of sinners that need help. Many
              of my teachers and pastors are sinners. And they need my help. I
              take the lesson from Psalms and hope they repent just like I did.

            <h2>'God Bless America'</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">July 4, 2022 by RJ</p>
            <p>
              This was a phrase we sang almost everyday in grade school.
              <i>God Bless America.</i> That actually meant something back then.
              Now it's something you hardly hear and when you do, you don't
              believe the ugly person saying it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't speak or read Arabic, but people say it's a beautiful
              language. I try to believe that -- but when people people show
              signs that say 'God Bless America' in Arabic it doesn't feel right
              -- how do I know that's what it actually says anyway?

                John 6:68-69<br />

                to know, that you are the Holy One of God.”

              We can see from this special version that Simone Peter is say
              where we go to the One, we should all ago. Question is, how many
              truly believe this.

              One way to follow God is follow those that most like God. I may

            <h2>Was Jesus a Socialist?</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">August 31, 2022 by RJ</p>
            <p>Definitely NOT.</p>
            <p>
              The idea was not even invented yet, so there was no way Jesus
              could be. But I also know with near certainty that Jesus
              <i>would be</i> a Friedman capitalist if he had the choice -- it
              just makes sense!

            <p>
              I was talking to some non-beleivers (AKA Democrats) and they asked
              me that if I died tonight would I know if I would end up in
              Heaven. First off, I found that question to be a non-sequitor, but
              I thought about it for a while, and I know for certain that I
              <i>would</i> be in Heaven. Here's why:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>God wants me to be happy and in Heaven</li>
              <li>
                I truly believe that Jesus died for your sins and that my own
                actions cannot save you
